Fashion Recommendation System 👗🧥👟
This project is a Personalized Fashion Recommendation System that uses advanced Deep Learning techniques to suggest visually similar fashion items based on an uploaded image. It is designed to provide tailored recommendations for clothing and accessories, making it a valuable tool for e-commerce, fashion retail, or personal use.

Features 🚀
Image-Based Recommendations: Users can upload an image, and the system suggests visually similar items from a curated fashion dataset.
Deep Learning Models: Utilizes VGG16 for feature extraction to analyze color, texture, pattern, and style.
Cosine Similarity: Matches the uploaded image with dataset items based on visual features to ensure accurate recommendations.
Streamlit Deployment: A user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction.
Curated Dataset: Includes 538 high-quality fashion images.
Technologies Used 🛠️
Python: Core programming language.
Deep Learning: Using TensorFlow/Keras for feature extraction.
Streamlit: For building an interactive and visually appealing UI.
Pandas/Numpy: For data manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For cosine similarity computation.

Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Network is a specialized neural network designed for visual data, such as images & videos. But CNNs also work well for non-image data (especially in NLP & text classification).

Its concept is similar to that of a vanilla neural network (multilayer perceptron) – It follows the same general principle of forwarding & backward propagation.

Once the data is pre-processed, the neural networks are trained, utilizing transfer learning from ResNet50. More additional layers are added in the last layers that replace the architecture and weights from ResNet50 in order to fine-tune the network model to serve the current issue. The figure shows the ResNet50 architecture.
